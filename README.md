## Optimizing Neural Networks by pruning them

This repository has code examples demonstrating model pruning and optimizations.
The pruning of neural networks is done by iteratively removing connections between layers, given a user specified schedule and end goal network sparsity.


### Prerequisites
In order to execute the codes, you will need to have:
* Python 3.X
* TensorFlow 2.0
* "tensorflow-model-optimization" package
